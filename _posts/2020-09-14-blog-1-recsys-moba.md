The video game industry has adopted recommendation systems to boost users' interest with a focus on game sales. Other exciting applications within video games are those that help the player to make decisions that would maximize their gaming experience. In this blog, I am going to present to you a research focused on the second application that resulted in two papers presented in RecSys.

## MOBA Games and Recommendation Problem

The annual [report of Newzoo](https://strivesponsorship.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Global-Esports-Market-Report-2020.pdf) shows that global e-sports revenues and its audience will grow to $1.1 billion and 495
million people in 2020, respectively. MOBA is one of the most significant social gaming genres contributing to
that growth. An example of this phenomenon is the League of Legends World Championship, which was the biggest
tournament of 2019 with more than 105 million hours live on Twitch and YouTube. This type of games can rise up to 64
million active players per month worldwide, with over a billion monthly gaming hours, affirms [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/27/riots-league-of-legends-reveals-astonishing-27-million-daily-players-67-million-monthly/#1461159b6d39).

League of Legends (LoL) has dominated the market since 2012 and is considered one of the most popular electronic games. The game consists of two teams (red and blue) of five players each, that compete to be the first to destroy the enemy base. Each player controls one character (champion) that interacts with the rest through combats, which are carried out in a particular arena.
