The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed how we write, think, and now, code. This keynote explores the evolution of LLMs, highlighting their transformative impact on tasks such as debugging, writing, and optimizing code. By introducing the paradigm of “Vibe Coding,” it examines the new way of collaborating with AI agents to tackle coding challenges through natural language instructions and iterative refinement. Core competencies essential for leveraging these tools effectively—including problem decomposition, framework selection, checkpoints, debugging, and contextual prompting—are discussed to equip developers with practical strategies for integrating AI assistants in modern workflows. Emphasis is placed on balancing reliance on AI with critical software engineering skills, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
