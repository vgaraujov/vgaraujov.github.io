I am currently a PhD student at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/programas-de-estudio/postgrado/doctorado-ciencias-la-ingenieria/) and [KU Leuven](https://eng.kuleuven.be/en/research/phd), advised by Professors [Alvaro Soto](https://asoto.ing.puc.cl/) and [Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/).

My main research interest is Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, specifically on how to extend current approaches with mechanisms inspired by human language processing.

Previously, I received my master's degree from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana focused on machine learning and serious games.
