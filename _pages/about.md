I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [ESAT-PSI, KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi), under the guidance of [Tinne Tuytelaars](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/TT) and [Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/). My primary research focuses on Language Models and Continual Learning.

I have recently completed a joint PhD program from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile and KU Leuven under the guidance of Professors [Alvaro Soto](https://asoto.ing.puc.cl/) and [Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/). My research was dedicated to enhancing language models by incorporating insights drawn from human language processing. During this time, I was affiliated with esteemed laboratories and institutions such as [LIIR](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/), [IALab](https://ialab.ing.puc.cl/), [IMFD](https://imfd.cl/en/), and [CENIA](https://www.cenia.cl/en/home/). Before my doctoral studies, I earned a master's degree from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, specializing in machine learning and serious games.
